# Compare tools task
## Task: 
Tell me key differences of Playwright vs Cypress testing framework.

## Solution:
Playwright and Cypress are both popular JavaScript-based testing frameworks that are used to write automated end-to-end tests for web applications. Although they share some similarities, they have some key differences that set them apart from each other.
Here are some of the key differences between Playwright and Cypress:
1. Browser support: One of the biggest differences between the two frameworks is the number of browsers they support. Playwright supports a wide range of browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, while Cypress only supports Chromium-based browsers like Chrome and Edge.
2. Cross-browser testing: Playwright provides built-in cross-browser testing capabilities, allowing you to run tests on multiple browsers simultaneously, which is not available in Cypress.
3. Programming languages: While both frameworks support JavaScript, Playwright also supports Python and Java, making it a more versatile option for developers who prefer to write tests in other programming languages.
4. API design: Playwright has a more object-oriented and modular API design, allowing developers to create custom abstractions for their tests. On the other hand, Cypress has a simpler API that is easier to learn and use for new developers.
5. Test execution: Playwright allows you to run tests in parallel, which can help speed up the testing process, while Cypress runs tests sequentially. 
6. Debugging: Cypress provides a built-in interactive debugger that makes it easier to debug tests. Playwright also has debugging tools, but they are not as robust as Cypress.
7. Overall, both Playwright and Cypress are powerful testing frameworks that can help automate web application testing. However, the choice between the two depends on the specific needs and requirements of your testing project, such as the browsers you need to support, the programming languages you prefer to use, and the level of complexity of your tests.
